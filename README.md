## Overview

This gallery is built with a responsive grid system that allows the rescaling of text and images to fit different device screen sizes. I used 4 breakpoints for phone, tablet portrait, tablet landscape and desktop. A different approach to breakpoints was implemented, thinking of devices as ranges instead of limits. Visit the Acknowledgements section to read an article by David Gilbertson about the topic.
